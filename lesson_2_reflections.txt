1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you run "git init" you create the hidden .git directory which git will use to track history (commits, etc.)  If you don't do this, you will not be able to utilize git functionality to provide version control of your files.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an area that is in flux, or is in draft status.  It is used to prepare files and data that are ready to be committed to the repository.  It can be thought of as a sandbox, or scratch area, where everything can be edited, modified, and created to be ready to add to the repository, then added when everything is ready.
